In this project we are planning to implement an Artificial Neural Network(ANN) and a
Linear regression model. We will study the ML algorithms and how to implement them in
OCAML. Our biggest motivation behind selecting Ocaml for implementing Neural Network
is Ocamlâ€™s execution speed. It provides the comfort of writing close to python and execution
speed close to C/C++.
